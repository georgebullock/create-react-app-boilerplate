## Create React App Boilerplate

A configured Create React App TypeScript project. I use it for prototyping, learning, and interview take-home projects. The setup includes:

- Routing via React Router
- Formatting via Prettier
- Styling via Styled Components
- Module Linting via ESLint
- CSS Linting via ESLint
- Unit Testing via Jest and React Testing Library
- Precommit validation via Husky and Lint Staged

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

2. Start the project

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```
